/*1) we made car class in which we do not defined drive feature like playlist  but we declare drive feature bcz we don't know how to implement drive ,
 i.e how to drive car ,car don't know how to drive but grantarino which is real car know's how to drive so instead of declaring it we define the drive in  grantarino
 so we use abstract keyword for drive bcz we have abstract idea ,and its giving error so we also use for car class
 2) so we have only abstract method in abstract class.
 3) we can not create object of abstract class
